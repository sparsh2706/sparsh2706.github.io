## Bio

A software developer and a forever learner trying to piece together all the various product ideas I get. I have a strong background working in Python development frameworks which includes the development of 2 full-stack Games played by approximately 150+ people using Flask and Django respectively for the second level of the Technothlon, microservices for identity management and role-based access. Python has always stood out as my core programming language and most of my skills are based on the same.
I also have 2 years of experience in Deep Learning and Data Science which includes building up the Computer vision aspects of an entire Humanoid Robot whilst I was working with an amazing team in IITG, creating a Parkinson's Disease Detection Tool web-app on Flask with Tensorflow as the backend engine. I've worked on many small projects involving ML and Data science and absolutely loved the prospects it had to offer.

I had also functioned as the Chief Organiser as well as the Online Head of Technothlon, an International exam conducted by the IITG fraternity with the responsibility of developing and maintaining all the online aspects of it which has upskilled me in Web development using PHP Laravel, Database management using mySQL and App development using Flutter. It had also boosted my management skills since I was responsible for the registrations of the exam in entire East zone of India and had to lead a team of 50+ people.

Currently, I continue to work as a Python developer although I love learning new things which the entire ecosystem has to offer, and have been trying my hands-on Smart Contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain using Solidity. I'd suppose I can call myself an aspiring web3 developer.

Apart from all the programming aspects of my career, I love to write content be it blogs, or even technical documentation. Needless to say, I'll always be forever fascinated by what a bunch of code can do in this world which always makes me wonder about working to build an amazing product for people :)
